# Doubleback
Doubleback provides round-trip parsing and printing of 64-bit double-precision floating-point numbers using the Ryu algorithm implemented in multiple programming languages. Doubleback is biased towards "human-friendly" output which round-trips consistently between binary and decimal.

# Status

# Roadmap for first release
* Import ulfjack/ryu
* Separate c and java
