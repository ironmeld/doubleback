# Doubleback
Doubleback provides round-trip parsing and printing of 64-bit double-precision floating-point numbers using the Ryu algorithm implemented in multiple programming languages. Doubleback is biased towards "human-friendly" output which round-trips consistently between binary and decimal.

The Doubleback project unifies code forked from various github projects. See Acknowledgements.

# Status
Doubleback is in development and is not ready for use or contributions.

# Roadmap for first release
* Setup global makefile
